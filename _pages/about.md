I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China**, advised by Prof. **[Hu Xiong](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/xionghu/zh_CN/index.htm)**.

My research interests lie broadly in **Computer Security** and **Authentication**, with a specific focus on **Password Security** and **Honeyword System**. Additionally, I am actively involved in a **Digital Watermarking** project, specifically dedicating to the development of robust **Text Watermarking** algorithms for copyright protection and content authentication.

I have published several papers in top-tier journals, including **IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (IEEE TIFS)**, **IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (IEEE TITS)**, and **IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IEEE IoTJ)**.

Research is never a solitary journey. I take great pride in working within a supportive team and collaborating with talented colleagues **Kaiwen Xing**, **Zhenjia Xiao**, and **Jincheng Li**. I am also grateful for the guidance of my supervisor Prof. **Hu Xiong**, and the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. **Kaitai Liang** from the **University of Turku**.

Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I received my B.Eng. degree from **Southwest University of Science and Technology**.

### 💡 Inspirations
My research path is continuously illuminated by the pioneering works of leading scholars. I hold great admiration for the contributions of **Prof. [Ding Wang](https://cyber.nankai.edu.cn/)** (Nankai University) and **Prof. [Weili Han](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/)** (Fudan University), whose fundamental works in password security have profoundly shaped my understanding of the field. I highly recommend their publications to anyone interested in this domain.
